    // `fortune-cookie-text` to be able to insert text into that element.

    // TODO: Update the Previous Fortunes list with the current `innerText`
    // value of `#fortune-cookie-text`. Follow these steps:
        // 1. Create a new `li` element with the `document.createElement()` method.
        // 2. Set the `innerText` of that element equal to the `innerText` of
        //    the `#fortune-cookie-text` element.
        // 3. Select the `#previous-fortune-cookies` container and use
        //    `appendChild()` to append the new `li` element you created above.
        // 4. You should see the previous fortune cookie saying show up in the list.

    // TODO: Select a new (random) fortune cookie saying from the data stored in the
    // `fortunesList` variable. (HINT: You will use `Math.floor()` and
    // `Math.random()` to accomplish this.) Use this data to update the
    // `innerText` of the `#fortune-cookie-text` element.
